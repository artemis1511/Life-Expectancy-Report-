# Life-Expectancy-Report-
This report takes a look at life expectancy Globally and some of the factors that affect life expectancy.
#  Project Overview

In different Countries around the world even though two people are born on the same date at the same time one is  expected to live longer than the other.

How exactly is this life expectancy which we often see bandied about actually calculated ? What factors come into play ? This report takes a look at all these in providing insights into the life expectancy figures around the globe. 

### Data Preparation 

Data used for this report was gotten from Kaggle. It is life expectancy data between the years of 1985-2015.

### Data Processing 

Imported the data into PowerBI . Opened up Power Query to look into the quality of the data and found that the data was of high quality .

After this conducted initial exploration of the data to get good understanding of the columns of data which make up the dataset as a whole in order to know insights which could be drawn from them.

### Data Visualization

Having gained good understanding of the  data got to work on the report to be able to share insights gained. 

It is a two page report which I have put together  with page one giving an overview of life expectancy such as the fact that Japan has highest life expectancy around the world with 84 years and Sierra Leone the least at 34 years .Also shows 10 countries with highest alcohol intake globally 
Life expectancy growth over time is also depicted with a line chart 

Page 2 focuses on factors affecting life expectancy and insights drawn from that .

### Recommendations
From Analysis conducted some recommendations are made to the countries :

1 For nations who wish to better their life expectancy scores greater healthcare spending will lead to better life expectancy.

2 Excellent Schooling systems also improve life expectancy.

3 Higher Immunization rates equals higher life expectancy.
It is my firm belief that by following these recommendations countries will be able to increase their life expectancies.
